# CVErt Ops — Implementation Log

> **Purpose:** Running record of what was built in each phase, implementation decisions
> that are *not* already in PLAN.md, gotchas discovered, and quality check results.
> Append a new section for each phase or significant feature block.
>
> **Not a substitute for:** commit messages (what changed), PLAN.md (the PRD/spec),
> research.md (architectural rationale), implementation-pitfalls.md (anti-patterns to avoid).

### Implementation decisions / discoveries

**huma adapter import path** — The chi adapter is at
`github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2/adapters/humachi`, not
`github.com/danielgtaylor/huma/v2/humachi`. PLAN.md references it as `humachi`
but doesn't give the full path. The adapters live in an `adapters/` subdirectory.

**`go mod tidy` ordering** — `go mod tidy` strips packages that aren't imported
by any `.go` file. Running it before writing source files leaves go.mod almost
empty. The correct order is: write Go files first, then run `go mod tidy` (or
accept a two-pass workflow: `go get` all deps, write files, tidy again).

**`time.NewTimer` instead of `time.Sleep` in retry loop** — PLAN.md §18.3 shows
`time.Sleep(time.Duration(attempt) * time.Second)` in the DB connection retry
example. We used `time.NewTimer` + a `select` on `ctx.Done()` / `timer.C`
instead. This makes the retry loop context-aware (cancellable on shutdown signal)
while still satisfying the linear-backoff requirement. Pitfall-safe per
pitfalls.md §timer-leak because the loop is bounded (max 10 iterations) and the
timer fires before the next iteration.

**`WriteTimeout` and `//nolint:exhaustruct`** — The `exhaustruct` linter
(configured to enforce completeness only for `net/http.Server`) would flag the
intentionally-omitted `WriteTimeout`. A `//nolint:exhaustruct` comment with the
PLAN.md citation was added at the struct literal so the rationale is co-located
with the suppression.

**`migrate` subcommand uses `stdlib.OpenDB` not pgxpool** — `golang-migrate`
requires a `*sql.DB` (database/sql interface), not a pgxpool. Used
`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5/stdlib.OpenDB(*connConfig)` to get a pgx-backed
`*sql.DB` without pulling in a separate driver (`lib/pq`). This keeps pgx as the
single Postgres driver project-wide.

**`BasicWaitStrategies()` for testcontainers** — The postgres testcontainers
module (v0.40.0) provides `postgres.BasicWaitStrategies()` which combines
`wait.ForLog("database system is ready to accept connections").WithOccurrence(2)`
and `wait.ForListeningPort("5432/tcp")`. This is critical for non-Linux hosts
(Windows, macOS) where Docker uses a proxy — the log wait alone is flaky without
the port wait.

### Quality check results

**pitfall-check:** 0 issues across all categories. All applicable patterns
correctly applied; feed adapter / alert / auth categories are N/A for Phase 0.

**plan-check §18:** 17/17 required items satisfied.
- ⚠️ `job_queue` retention cleanup: correctly deferred to Phase 5 (§21). Must add
  `job_queue` to the retention cleanup job with a 24-hour window for `succeeded`
  and `dead` rows.
- ⚠️ Schema version verification in `serve`/`worker`: advisory ("should"), not
  required ("must"). Phase 1 candidate — add a startup check that the DB schema
  version matches the expected version before accepting traffic.

### Open items carried forward

- [ ] Phase 1: add `SHOW max_connections` startup warning if `DB_MAX_CONNS` is
  dangerously high (§19.2 requirement — not implementable without a DB connection
  at Phase 0 startup-check time).
- [ ] Phase 5: include `job_queue` in retention cleanup job (24-hour window,
  bounded-batch DELETE per §21.3).
- [ ] Phase 1+: schema version verification in `serve`/`worker` before accepting
  traffic.
