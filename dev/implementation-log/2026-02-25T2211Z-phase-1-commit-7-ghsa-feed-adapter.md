| `internal/feed/ghsa/adapter.go` | GHSA REST API adapter: cursor pagination via Link header, incremental sync via `updated>=` filter, alias resolution, `withdrawn_at` tombstone, affected packages from inline `vulnerabilities[]` array |

## Implementation decisions / discoveries

**REST API chosen over GraphQL** — The GHSA research agent (with verified web access via updated `AGENT.md`) confirmed the REST `GET /advisories` endpoint is superior to GraphQL for this adapter:
- Response is a top-level JSON array (simpler streaming — no wrapper key to navigate past)
- `cve_id` is a direct top-level field (no need to parse `identifiers[]`)
- `vulnerabilities[]` is inline per-advisory (no nested pagination required in GraphQL)
- Same rate limits (5,000 req/hr authenticated)
Endpoint: `GET https://api.github.com/advisories`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN`. Required headers: `Accept: application/vnd.github+json`, `X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28`.

**Pagination via Link header** — GitHub uses RFC 5988 `Link` response header with `rel="next"` for cursor pagination (not GraphQL `pageInfo.endCursor`). `parseLinkHeader` extracts the `after` param from the next-page URL. 100 records per page (`per_page=100`).

**Incremental sync** — `sort=updated&direction=asc` with `updated=>=TIMESTAMP` (GitHub search date range syntax). `url.Values.Set()` + `url.Values.Encode()` handles percent-encoding of `>=` and `:` chars. 15-minute lookback overlap applied to cursor. Sort ascending so cursor advances monotonically — prevents large re-ingestion window on mid-page failure.

**Type filter: `type=reviewed` only** — Unreviewed advisories lack structured CVE data and are out of scope for the corpus. Malware type excluded. Document this filter choice: `?type=reviewed`.

**Rate limit** — 5,000 req/hr authenticated (60/hr unauthenticated — effectively unusable for backfill). Adapter uses `rate.NewLimiter(rate.Every(1*time.Second), 1)` — well within the 1.39 req/sec ceiling. Token read from `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var.

**All pages in single Fetch call** — Full backfill is ~5,000 reviewed advisories (~50 pages at 1 req/sec = ~50 seconds). Acceptable within job timeout. Same pattern as OSV/KEV adapters.

**Alias resolution** — `cve_id` top-level field checked first (direct); `identifiers[]` where `type="CVE"` checked as fallback. `feed.ResolveCanonicalID(nativeID, aliases)` produces canonical ID. `patch.SourceID = nativeID` (always the GHSA ID).

**`withdrawn_at` tombstone** — Non-null `withdrawn_at` → `IsWithdrawn = true` + `Status = "withdrawn"`. Pipeline TombstoneCVE step NULLs out CVSS/EPSS scores.

**CVSS from `cvss_severities`** — Prefer `cvss_severities.cvss_v3`/`cvss_v4` (explicit version split) over the top-level `cvss` field (no version distinction). Top-level `cvss` used as V3 fallback.

**Affected packages from `vulnerabilities[]`** — GHSA provides `first_patched_version` as a string and `vulnerable_version_range` as a free-form string. Synthetic OSV-format events `[{"introduced":"0"},{"fixed":"VERSION"}]` constructed via `json.Marshal` (not string concatenation — avoids injection if version string contains special chars). `RangeType = "ECOSYSTEM"`.

**`feed-researcher` AGENT.md fix** — The OSV research agent (previous session) silently fell back to training data when web tools were unavailable. Updated `AGENT.md` to: (1) make WebSearch/WebFetch mandatory, (2) require success before writing anything, (3) define explicit failure message if tools unavailable rather than silent fallback.
