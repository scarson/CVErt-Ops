# Appendix C: Document Maintenance Guide

> This appendix tells you how to update this document correctly. A pitfall document that drifts from the codebase is worse than no document — it creates false confidence. Every update MUST follow the checklist below. No exceptions.

---

## When to Update This Document

Update this document when any of the following occur:

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Bug hunt finds a generalizable pattern | Add a pitfall to the appropriate domain section |
| Health review flags a cross-cutting issue | Add or strengthen a pitfall |
| Implementation reveals a prescribed fix was wrong | Update the existing pitfall to match reality — the code is the source of truth |
| Code review catches a pitfall already documented here | Strengthen the entry with the new example |
| A pitfall's prescribed fix is implemented | Update the entry's status in Appendix B |
| A feature is removed or an approach abandoned | Mark the pitfall as SUPERSEDED with a note explaining why |
| testing-pitfalls.md adds a new section | Check if a cross-reference should be added here |

**Do NOT update this document for:**
- One-off implementation bugs that don't generalize to a pattern
- Code style preferences or formatting choices
- Performance optimizations without correctness implications

## How to Add a Pitfall

### Step 1: Choose the domain section

| If the pitfall is about... | Add to section... |
|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Feed adapters, streaming, ZIP, cursors, aliases | §1 Feed Adapters |
| Store methods, migrations, SQL, RLS, transaction helpers | §2 Database & Query |
| Auth, OAuth, JWT, API keys, MFA, secrets, lockout | §3 Authentication & Security |
| HTTP handlers, middleware, pagination, validation | §4 API Design & HTTP |
| Alert evaluation, notification delivery, webhooks | §5 Notification & Alert |
| Startup, config, deployment, scheduling, cross-cutting | §6 Architecture & Operations |

If the pitfall spans two domains, place it where the reader is most likely to look when they encounter the bug. Add a "See Also" cross-reference in the other section.

### Step 2: Assign the next ID

IDs are sequential within each section: `FEED-21`, `DB-26`, `AUTH-26`, etc. Check the last entry in the section and increment.

### Step 3: Write the entry

**For complex findings** (non-obvious failure mode or architectural fix):
```markdown
### SECTION-N: Title

**The Flaw:** What the code does wrong or what's missing.
**Why It Matters:** The production failure mode — what breaks, for whom, and why it's hard to detect.
**The Fix:** The specific code change or pattern to apply. Include a code example when the fix is non-trivial.
**The Lesson:** The generalizable principle. What should the reader watch for in future code?
```

**For simple findings** (one-line pattern substitution, self-evident why):
```markdown
### SECTION-N: Title
[One paragraph: what's wrong, what to do instead, and why. No code example needed.]
```

**Use the right heuristic:** If an implementing agent could correctly apply the fix from just a one-line description without understanding the failure mode, use the condensed format. If they'd need to understand WHY to apply it correctly, use the full format.

### Step 4: Update the review checklist

Add a checkbox item to the section's review checklist (§X.C) that captures the key check for this pitfall.

### Step 5: Update the Table of Contents

Update the entry count in the TOC table (e.g., `FEED-1 – FEED-21`).

### Step 6: Update the Summary Table

Add a row to Appendix B with the pitfall ID, title, severity, status, and domain.

### Step 7: Check for cross-references

- Does testing-pitfalls.md need a corresponding test guidance entry?
- Does another domain section need a "See Also" pointer?
- Does the same pattern exist elsewhere in the codebase? (See §ARCH-31: Pattern-Level Fixes Must Be Applied Codebase-Wide — this applies to the document itself.)

## How to Update an Existing Pitfall

1. **Read the current entry** and understand its intent
2. **Check the code** to see what actually changed
3. **Update the entry** to reflect reality — never preserve a prescription that contradicts the code
4. **Update Appendix B** status if it changed (e.g., UNIMPLEMENTED → VALIDATED)
5. **Check Appendix A** — add a changelog line noting the update date and reason

---

## How to Mark a Pitfall as Superseded

Do NOT delete pitfall entries. Mark them:

```markdown
### SECTION-N: Title

> **SUPERSEDED (2026-XX-XX):** [Reason — e.g., "Feature removed in Phase 12" or "Replaced by SECTION-M which covers the broader pattern"]

[Original content preserved below for historical context]
```

Update Appendix B status to SUPERSEDED.

## Completeness Checklist

**A pitfall update is not complete until ALL of these are done.** Partial updates are how this document drifts — and a drifted document is worse than no document, because it creates false confidence in protections that don't exist.

- [ ] Entry written in the correct domain section with the correct format
- [ ] Entry has the next sequential ID for its section
- [ ] TOC entry count updated
- [ ] Appendix B summary table row added/updated
- [ ] Review checklist (§X.C) updated with the corresponding check item
- [ ] Cross-references checked: testing-pitfalls.md, other domain sections, See Also block
- [ ] If the pattern could exist elsewhere in the codebase: grepped for other instances (§ARCH-31)
- [ ] Appendix A changelog updated with date and source

**If you skip any of these steps, the next agent to read this document will not find your pitfall.** The TOC is the routing table — without it, your entry is invisible. The summary table is the audit trail — without it, the next health review won't know your finding was addressed.

## Periodic Review Schedule

| Trigger | Review Scope |
|---------|-------------|
| After each bug hunt cycle | Check if any findings should be new pitfalls |
| After each health review | Check for cross-cutting patterns and enforcement gaps |
| After each phase completion | Verify pitfalls referenced in the phase plan were followed |
| Quarterly (or after 3+ phases) | Full validation audit: do prescriptions still match code? |

The 2026-03-18 audit (Wave 1) established the baseline. The `dev/pitfall-meta-reviews/` directory contains the audit artifacts and methodology for future audits.

## Voice and Style Reference

This document uses persuasion principles to ensure agents follow critical practices:

- **Authority** for bright-line rules: "MUST", "Never", "Always", "No exceptions"
- **Implementation intentions** for triggers: "When writing a PATCH handler, ALWAYS use pointer types"
- **Social proof via failure modes**: "Without this, the webhook client follows redirects to internal metadata endpoints — every time"
- **Commitment** via checklists: the review checklists at the end of each section

Reference: `C:\Users\Sam\.claude\plugins\cache\superpowers-marketplace\superpowers\4.3.1\skills\writing-skills\persuasion-principles.md`

When writing pitfall entries, apply these principles. A pitfall that says "consider using X" will be ignored under pressure. A pitfall that says "MUST use X — without it, Y happens every time" will be followed.
